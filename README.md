# Dart Telegram Bot 1


A notifier bot which tracks digital/fiat currency rates.

How it should work:

- you first tell the bot that you want it to watch the rate of a pair of currencies on a market like ByBit
- bot adds this task to its list and starts to pull updates
- whenever rate hits the provided threshold, bot sends you a message.

# Markets

A list of exchange markers to support:

- [ ] ByBit
- [ ] Binance
